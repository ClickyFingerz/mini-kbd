= Firmware for Mini-kbd

Please visit https://kmkfw.io[KMk] to install KMK on the
the controller. When the controller remounts, please copy
the files in this folder to the root folder. Please delete
`code.py` if it exists.

Please edit `main.py` so that the `split_side` is set 
correctly for each side.

If you want to change the keymap, please edit `main.py` as
necessary.

Please use an empty `boot.py` during development. Once you
use the `boot.py` in this folder, the microcontroller will
no longer be mounted as an external drive. If you want it
to mount, then please press the outer-most, reachy, thumb
key while connecting the keyboard to the computer.
